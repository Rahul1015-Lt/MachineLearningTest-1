    "Q1: Explain the following with an example:\n",
    "1) Artificial Intelligence (AI)\n",
    "AI is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that can think, reason, and make decisions.\n",
    "âœ… Example: Voice assistants like Alexa or Siri use AI to understand and respond to voice commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Machine Learning (ML)\n",
    "ML is a subset of AI that enables machines to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.\n",
    "âœ… Example: A spam filter that learns to detect spam emails by analyzing patterns in previously labeled emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Deep Learning (DL)\n",
    "DL is a subset of ML that uses neural networks with many layers to learn from large amounts of data.\n",
    "âœ… Example: Face recognition in smartphones uses deep learning to accurately identify facial features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2: What is supervised learning? List some examples of supervised learning.\n",
    "Supervised learning involves training a model on a labeled dataset, where both input and correct output are provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "âœ… Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "Email spam detection\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Predicting house prices\n",
    "\n",
    "Image classification (e.g., cat vs dog)\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3: What is unsupervised learning? List some examples of unsupervised learning.\n",
    "Unsupervised learning involves training on unlabeled data, where the algorithm finds patterns and structures in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "âœ… Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer segmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Market basket analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Anomaly detection\n",
    "\n",
    "Document clustering\n",

    "Q4: Difference between AI, ML, DL, and DS\n",
    "Term\tDescription\tExample\n",
    "AI\tBroad field mimicking human intelligence\tSiri, self-driving cars\n",
    "ML\tSubset of AI, learns from data\tRecommendation systems\n",
    "DL\tSubset of ML using neural networks\tImage recognition\n",
    "DS (Data Science)\tAnalyzing data to extract insights (uses AI/ML)\tBusiness analytics, dashboards\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5: Differences between supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning\n",
    "Feature\tSupervised\tUnsupervised\tSemi-Supervised\n",
    "Data\tLabeled\tUnlabeled\tFew labeled + many unlabeled\n",
    "Task\tPrediction\tPattern discovery\tImprove performance with fewer labels\n",
    "Example\tEmail classification\tCustomer segmentation\tWeb page classification with limited labeled pages\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6: What is train, test and validation split? Importance?\n",
    "Training Set: Used to train the model (learn patterns).\n",
    "\n",
    "Validation Set: Used to tune parameters and avoid overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Test Set: Used to evaluate the final modelâ€™s performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸŽ¯ Why important?\n",
    "They help ensure the model generalizes well and performs accurately on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7: How can unsupervised learning be used in anomaly detection?\n",
    "In unsupervised learning, algorithms like clustering or autoencoders can detect data points that deviate significantly from the norm.\n",
    "\n",
    "âœ… Example: Credit card fraud detection â€” if a transaction doesnâ€™t fit the usual pattern, it's flagged as an anomaly.\n",
