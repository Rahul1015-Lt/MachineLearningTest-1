Q1: Explain the following with an example:
1) Artificial Intelligence (AI)
AI is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that can think, reason, and make decisions.
âœ… Example: Voice assistants like Alexa or Siri use AI to understand and respond to voice commands.

2) Machine Learning (ML)
ML is a subset of AI that enables machines to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.
âœ… Example: A spam filter that learns to detect spam emails by analyzing patterns in previously labeled emails.

3) Deep Learning (DL)
DL is a subset of ML that uses neural networks with many layers to learn from large amounts of data.
âœ… Example: Face recognition in smartphones uses deep learning to accurately identify facial features.

Q2: What is supervised learning? List some examples of supervised learning.
Supervised learning involves training a model on a labeled dataset, where both input and correct output are provided.

âœ… Examples:

Email spam detection

Sentiment analysis

Predicting house prices

Image classification (e.g., cat vs dog)

Q3: What is unsupervised learning? List some examples of unsupervised learning.
Unsupervised learning involves training on unlabeled data, where the algorithm finds patterns and structures in the data.

âœ… Examples:

Customer segmentation

Market basket analysis

Anomaly detection

Document clustering

Q4: Difference between AI, ML, DL, and DS
Term	Description	Example
AI	Broad field mimicking human intelligence	Siri, self-driving cars
ML	Subset of AI, learns from data	Recommendation systems
DL	Subset of ML using neural networks	Image recognition
DS (Data Science)	Analyzing data to extract insights (uses AI/ML)	Business analytics, dashboards

Q5: Differences between supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning
Feature	Supervised	Unsupervised	Semi-Supervised
Data	Labeled	Unlabeled	Few labeled + many unlabeled
Task	Prediction	Pattern discovery	Improve performance with fewer labels
Example	Email classification	Customer segmentation	Web page classification with limited labeled pages

Q6: What is train, test and validation split? Importance?
Training Set: Used to train the model (learn patterns).

Validation Set: Used to tune parameters and avoid overfitting.

Test Set: Used to evaluate the final modelâ€™s performance.

ðŸŽ¯ Why important?
They help ensure the model generalizes well and performs accurately on unseen data.

Q7: How can unsupervised learning be used in anomaly detection?
In unsupervised learning, algorithms like clustering or autoencoders can detect data points that deviate significantly from the norm.

âœ… Example: Credit card fraud detection â€” if a transaction doesnâ€™t fit the usual pattern, it's flagged as an anomaly.
